# UIStyleGuide
This design style guide was created for a government agency.  Originally, the organization was using a wiki to document all their design decisions.
To improve the aesthetics of the guide, I created a cohesive guide using basic HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library.  I've modified the guide so that it's generic and can easily be changed to suit another organization's need.
